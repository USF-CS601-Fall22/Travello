# Travello
The goal of the final project is to implement a website with a subset of the functionality of tripadvisor (or oyster.com, hotels.com), where users can register, login, search for hotels, read reviews written by other people, write and edit their own reviews, etc. 

## General Requirements (for both parts of the project)

- You are required to implement both the front end and the back end. 
- 	Your code should be in Java (plus some Javascript for the front end as needed).
- You are required to use Jetty/servlets for this project. 
- You may either use the departmental MySql database assigned to you (see MySqlAccounts.pdf under Schedule), or use a locally installed MySql database.

- Using Twitter Bootstrap is highly recommended.
